# Slide 2: Strategic Roadmap & Way Forward (2025-2030)

## Emerging Threats Horizon 2025-2030
### **Quantum Computing Threat**
- **Timeline Risk**: "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" already underway
- **Readiness Gap**: BFSI average PQC readiness score: 2.4/5
- **CERT-In Mandate**: Phased PQC migration required for critical infrastructure
- **Priority Systems**: UPI, RTGS, NEFT, customer data archives

### **AI-Powered Cyberattacks**
- **Deepfake Evolution**: $40B projected global losses by 2027
- **Vishing Surge**: 442% increase in 2025
- **Malicious LLMs**: WormGPT, FraudGPT enabling sophisticated attacks
- **Response Needed**: AI-powered defense stacks with deepfake detection

### **Converged Fraud Operations**
- **Synthetic Identities**: AI-generated bypassing traditional KYC
- **Mule Networks**: Automated account creation and money laundering
- **RBI Innovation**: MuleHunter.AI deployment for detection

## Five Strategic Pillars for 2030 Resilience

### **Pillar 1: Identity-First Zero Trust**
- Phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/passkeys) for all users
- Micro-segmentation to contain lateral movement
- Continuous risk-based authentication
- **Timeline**: 95% user adoption by FY27

### **Pillar 2: Supply Chain Fortification**
- Mandatory SBOMs from all critical vendors
- Continuous third-party risk monitoring
- Contractual 6-hour breach notification SLAs
- Joint BCP/DR drills with critical providers

### **Pillar 3: AI-Powered SOC Modernization**
- "Build-Buy-Partner" talent strategy
- SOAR and XDR platforms for automation
- Shared SOC models for smaller entities
- **ROI**: 50% faster case resolution times

### **Pillar 4: Quantum Migration Roadmap**
```
Phase 1 (2025-26): CBOM creation + crypto-agility design
Phase 2 (2026-28): Hybrid PQC for critical systems
Phase 3 (2028-30): Enterprise-wide PQC deployment
```

### **Pillar 5: Fraud-Cyber Threat Fusion**
- Unified Threat Fusion Centers
- Integrated data lakes (transactions + telemetry)
- Cross-sector collaboration (telecom, law enforcement)
- Real-time behavioral analytics

## Sector-Specific Implementation Priorities

### **Large Banks** (36-month timeline)
- Red Team operations modeled on TIBER-EU
- PQC migration for payment systems
- Advanced threat intelligence sharing

### **NBFCs & Fintechs** (24-month timeline)
- Shared SOC/MSSP partnerships
- Cloud security posture management
- DPDP Act compliance frameworks

### **Payment Systems** (12-month timeline)
- API security lifecycle management
- AI-driven real-time fraud prevention
- Tokenization expansion

### **Insurance Companies** (18-month timeline)
- Ransomware resilience with immutable backups
- Data loss prevention部署
- Crisis management with board participation

## Policy Recommendations for Global Competitiveness
1. **Unified Regulatory Reporting Portal**: Single interface for RBI/SEBI/IRDAI/CERT-In
2. **PQC Adoption Incentives**: Tax benefits + "Make in India" quantum solutions
3. **National Threat Intelligence Platform**: Legal safe harbor for sharing
4. **Cyber Resilience Stress Testing**: India-specific TLPT framework
5. **National Cyber Workforce Mission**: Standardized curricula + Tier 2/3 city development

## Investment Requirements 2025-2030
- **Total BFSI Investment**: ₹60,000+ crore ($7.2B)
- **PQC Migration**: ₹15,000 crore ($1.8B)
- **AI/ML Security**: ₹12,000 crore ($1.4B)
- **SOC Modernization**: ₹18,000 crore ($2.1B)
- **Workforce Development**: ₹8,000 crore ($960M)

## Key Success Metrics
- **Cyber Resilience**: <24 hours detection, <72 hours full recovery
- **Fraud Reduction**: <2 basis points digital fraud loss rate
- **Compliance**: Zero regulatory penalties for cyber failures
- **Innovation Enablement**: Security as business enabler, not constraint
